The *PFAC* library is based on the _Parallel Failureless-AC_ Algorithm proposed at the IEEE GLOBECOM 2010. The PFAC algorithm efficiently exploits the parallelism of the AC algorithm by creating an individual thread for each byte of an input stream to identify any pattern starting at the threadâ€™s starting position. The number of threads created by the PFAC algorithm is equal to the length of an input stream.
