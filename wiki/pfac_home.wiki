= Introduction =

The *PFAC* library is based on the _Parallel Failureless-AC_ Algorithm proposed at the IEEE GLOBECOM 2010. 


= Details =
The PFAC algorithm efficiently exploits the parallelism of the *Aho-Corasick* algorithm by creating an individual thread for each byte of an input stream to identify any pattern starting at the threadâ€™s starting position. The number of threads created by the PFAC algorithm is equal to the length of an input stream.
